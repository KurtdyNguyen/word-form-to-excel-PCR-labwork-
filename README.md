# word-form-to-excel-PCR-labwork

Automate the mind-numbing chore of copy-pasting data from .docx files to .xlsx. This one is used particularly for my PCR lab work.

With python installed on machine, run `python gui.py` to use the script. Make sure the necessary python packages are present: pandas, openpyxl, python-docx. Try using pip or such.

Thank you big sister Trang for the oppoturnity for this project to proceed.
